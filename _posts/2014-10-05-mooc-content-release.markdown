title:  "Staggered vs. All-At-Once Content Release in Massive Open Online Courses: Evaluating a Natural Experiment"
category: research
priority: 10

This paper, based on a chapter of my undergraduate thesis, was accepted and published at [Learning at Scale 2015](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2724663&CFID=828994356&CFTOKEN=37371972). I was lucky enough to get to travel to Vancouver and present my findings at the conference. 

The paper addresses two research questions:

1. Does releasing all content at the beginning of the course (rather than sequentially) lead to more variation in student progress and less "ontrackness" (as measured by the courses recommended schedule)? Short answer: Yes, but in both content release strategies the vast majority of students proceed at  individualized and off-track paces.

2. Are there benefits to staying on-track? Short answer: Staying on-track has a modest positive correlation with certification, but such modest benefits to staying on-track must be weighed against the benefits of allowing students flexibility in how they move through the course. Releasing content upfront and all-at-once appears to be a viable strategy for MOOC designers. 

I owe a huge thank you to [Justin Reich](http://www.edtechresearcher.com/), without whom this project would never have gotten off the ground.
