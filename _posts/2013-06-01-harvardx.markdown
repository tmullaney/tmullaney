During my Junior year at Harvard, I started working with the [HarvardX](http://harvardx.harvard.edu/) and [MITx](http://odl.mit.edu/beyond-campus/mitx-edx-moocs) research teams to clean and analyze data generated by students taking courses on edX, an open-source platform for massive open online courses (MOOCs). 

I contributed to the [HarvardX-Tools](https://github.com/jimwaldo/HarvardX-Tools) repo with a set of Python scripts to extract, parse, and sanitize data from edX clickstream tracking logs. I was also a co-author on the first 15 [HarvardX and MITx Working Papers](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2381263), which report general statistics and early findings from Harvard and MIT's first wave of MOOCs on the edX platform (Fall 2012 to Summer 2013). 

All in all, I got very cozy with Python, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. I had tons of fun and learned a lot from the experience, and I can't thank the HarvardX and MITx research groups enough for welcoming me into the group.
