A professional-grade investing app for iPhone and iPad, MarketShark helps you research stock fundamentals and track your portfolio on the go. I developed MarketShark with [Bryson Alef](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brysonalef) after a summer internship in private equity, where I discovered that software for researching stock fundamentals was prohibitively expensive for all but large enterprises.    

After Rhythmatic's success, MarketShark was largely experimental:
 * We tried setting the price at $4.99 and at $19.99 to increase revenue and drive the perception that MarketShark was professional-grade software. It turned out that $19.99 had a more positive overall impact on revenue.
 * We raised money and tried buying several thousand dollars worth of online banner ads on popular investing sites like Seeking Alpha and The Motley Fool. It turned out to be an expensive lesson: The cost of acquiring a customer via banner ads was significantly more than the revenue they brought in. Find other ways to advertise!
