Diaballic is an endless side-scrolling platformer game for iOS, written in Objective-C using the [Cocos2D engine](http://cocos2d.org). 

I developed it in high school as the culmination of my effort to teach myself how to program computer games (I had yet to take a Computer Science class in school). After working through Stanford's introductory [CS106A: Programming Methodology](https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/programming-methodology/id384232896?mt=10) course on iTunesU while playing squash in Europe during the summer, I made my dream come true and released the first version of Diaballic on the App Store. It was downloaded a few thousand times and got me hooked on building iOS apps.
