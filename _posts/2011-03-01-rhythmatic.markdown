Rhythmatic is my iOS claim to fame. It's a rhythm game akin to Guitar Hero or Tap Tap Revenge, but unique in that a self-developed beat detection algorithm generates tap tracks to any song in your music library. It was downloaded over 300,000 times and at one point was the [#1 Overall Game](/img/rhythmatic-app-store-no-1.png) in the Japanese App Store, thanks to a well-executed marketing campaign on Free App a Day. 

Rhythmatic was a technical challenge for me: I had to learn a lot of new concepts from digital signal processing, like Fast Fourier Transforms and spectral flux-based onset detection. The end result was a popular game that validated my belief that the best products are those that you make for yourself.
