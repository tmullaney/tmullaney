I got super excited when I learned that all the lecture videos and course materials for Stanford's [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/index.html) course were freely available online. I had experience in machine learning through coursework at school, but I didn't have much specific expertise in neural networks and deep learning. So I decided to work through the course on my own after work -- much in the same way I worked through CS106A to learn how to program years ago.

The course was extremely well taught, and the techniques and concepts I learned motivated several other projects.
